            <p>Welcome to Last.fm MatchUp.</p>
            <p>A simple game based on your recently ACTIVE Last.fm friends and their listening habits. 
                This game takes the username of any given Last.fm user and populates a 
                current friends list and the top album each respective friend has listened to
                over the last week, month, or year. These albums are then shuffled and your job 
                is to match up the top album to the correct friend based on your knowledge of their taste in music.
            </p>
